# Oh No! I Just Lost My Depth Perception And Now I Have To Win This Ping-Pong Match!

Author: Will Ozeas

Design: In this game, you play ping pong, but it's pretty difficult to tell depth! So, instead, rely on the music and 
the sound of the ping pong rally to know when and where to hit!

How To Play:

Control the ping pong paddle with your mouse, and press space to hit the ball. Watch out for half-note and triplet rhythmic
shakeups!
